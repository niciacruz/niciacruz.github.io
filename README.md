# seaenchants
hello!

i'm nícia, a sea-lover, auDHD and gender non-conforming person, that currently homeschools her/their kid on a camping site, near (of course) the sea.

this is my digital garden: a place where I can indulge in my many special interests and learn in public.

## some of those interests are:

* **[counterculture](counterculture.md)** (simple living, homeschooling, anti/slow marketing, diy, and the like);
* **[neurodiversity](neurodiversity.md)** (especially the neurodivergent brain, I focus more on [ADHD](ADHD.md) and [autism](autism.md) as me and my kid are both [auDHD](auDHD.md));
* **[spirituality](spirituality.md)** (wicca, tarot, well-being, connection to self and nature);
* **[anthropology](anthropology.md)** (in general);
* and **[communication](communication.md)** (non-violent communication, self-expression, autistic communication).

## projects i'm involved

* i'm an **activist** on an autistic organisation: A Voz do Autista;
* i'm **[[homeschooling]]** my kid;
* i'm creating **[[macramé]]** stuff;
* i'm writting **[[poetry]]**;
* i'm giving **[[tarot]]** readings and using tarot for creative purposes;
* i'm learning how to **[[code]]**;
* i'm **studying/reading/watching** about a variety of subjects.

i invite you to share your insights and follow me on other platforms (i use mainly ko-fi, patreon and mastodon, just search for níciacruz or seaenchants).


thank you!
