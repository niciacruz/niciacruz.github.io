# seaenchants
hello!

i'm nícia, a sea-lover, auDHD and gender non-conforming person, that currently homeschools her/their kid on a camping site, near (of course) the sea.

this is my digital garden: a place where I can indulge in my many special interests and learn in public.

## some of those interests are:

* **counterculture** (living simply, homeschooling, anti/slow marketing, diy, and the like);
* **neurodiversity** (especially the neurodivergent brain, I focus more on ADHD and autism as me and my kid are both auDHD);
* **spirituality** (wicca, tarot, well-being, connection to self and nature);
* **anthropology** (in general);
* and **communication** (non-violent communication, self-expression, autistic communication).

## projects i'm involved

* i'm an **activist** on an autistic organisation: A Voz do Autista;
* i'm **homeschooling** my kid;
* i'm creating **macramé** stuff;
* i'm giving **tarot** readings and using tarot for creative purposes;
* i'm learning how to **code**.

i invite you to share your insights and follow me on other platforms (i use mainly ko-fi, patreon and mastodon, just search for níciacruz or seaenchants).


thank you!
